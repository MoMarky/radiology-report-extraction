There are no acute osseous abnormalities.",No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.
19914761,56042355,"Overlying trauma board limits evaluation.  Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  Orogastric tube is noted within the stomach and the tip projects off the inferior borders of the film.  Bilateral chest tubes are noted terminating near the lung apices.  Left subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates within the upper SVC.  The heart size is normal.  The superior mediastinum is widened.  Small bilateral pneumothoraces are present.  Minimal streaky opacity is noted in the left lung base, which could reflect atelectasis.  More focal opacity is also seen within the left mid lung field, which is nonspecific.  No pleural effusion is identified.  There are multiple bilateral rib fractures noted.",1. Lines and tubes in standard positions.  2. Widened superior mediastinum.  Subsequent CT of the torso demonstrated an extensive type A aortic dissection.  3. Small bilateral apical pneumothoraces.  4. Streaky opacity left lung base may reflect atelectasis.  More focal opacity in the left mid lung field is nonspecific but could reflect an area of aspiration or contusion.
19928916,53913561,There is no acute findings.  There is no pneumonia.  Stability of the right middle lobe calcified nodule.  There is no pneumothorax and no pleural effusion.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Consolidated fracture of the axillary portion of the seventh right rib Degenrative changes of the right shoulder.,There is no pneumonia.
19928916,54375943,"Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Low lung volumes noted.  Allowing for this, the lungs appear clear.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears normal.  A calcified granuloma projects over the right lateral mid lung.  Bony structures are intact.",No acute findings in the chest.
19991135,50286241,"PA and lateral chest views have been obtained with patient in upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Heart size and mediastinal structures are unchanged.  The previously described remaining pleural densities along the upper right lateral chest wall in the shoulder area show diminished thickness of the pleural density surrounding the operative area.  Postoperative localized apical pneumothorax has diminished further and is now barely 1 cm wide, also showing increasing pleural scar formation.  No new abnormalities are seen.  The left hemithorax is unchanged, though no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities.","Progression of postoperative healing, status post right upper lobectomy accomplished via VATS extended to thoracotomy intervention."
19991135,51777681,"PA and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is volume loss on the right with associated elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, consistent with the provided history of prior right upper lobectomy.  Pleural densities along the right upper lateral chest wall are not significantly changed.  Similarly, opacity at the right apex along the superior mediastinum is not significantly changed, possibly loculated fluid in the pleural space.  There is no focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  There is no left pleural effusion.  No definite pneumothorax is seen.  There is evidence of prior right thoracotomy, involving the right posterior sixth rib.  Cervical fusion hardware is incompletely assessed.","1.  No significant interval change. 2.  Post-surgical changes on the right, as described above."
19991135,54103833,"AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study obtained four hours earlier during the same day.  Again identified is status post right upper lobectomy with moderately elevated right-sided diaphragm and local chest wall emphysema in the right shoulder area.  No pneumothorax has developed since the preceding study, and no new infiltrates are seen.","Stable chest findings as seen on portable followup examination, status post right upper lobectomy."
19991135,54742755,Heart size is borderline enlarged but unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Hyperinflation of the lungs with bullous emphysematous changes are again noted in the upper lobes. Lungs are clear without focal consolidation. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present. Pulmonary vasculature is normal. Right-sided rib cage deformities are chronic. Partially visualized is cervical spinal fusion hardware.,No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  Bullous emphysema.
